Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

  The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare   tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

  This project contains the R script, run_analysis.R. This script can calculate means per activity, means per subject of the   mean and SD of the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset Version 1.0. This dataset should be downloaded and extracted directly into the data directory.

  The objectives are the following
  1.Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2.Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3.Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4.Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5.From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity   and each subject. 
  
  The CodeBook gives describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.
